Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

Project/Goals
Organise and manipulate the ecommerce data base using the tables to answer questions and make predictions.

Process
Create tables
Clean the data
Understant the data and its components
Use the data to answer questions


Results
I was able to use the data to dtermine the following:
Cities and countries that have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site.
The average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country.
There was no pattern in the types (product categories) of products ordered from visitors in each city and country.
The top-selling product from each city/country and that there was no pattern worthy of noting in the products sold.
The impact of revenue generated from each city/country.

Challenges 
There was not much information about the data and the source, most of the queries had to be written based on assumptions about the data.
The tables all_sessions, sales_by_sku and sales_report had productSKU which were not captured in the SKU column in the Product table.

Future Goals
Create more QA quries for my QA processes.
